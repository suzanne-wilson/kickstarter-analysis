### Module 1 Challenge

The objective of this challenge is to conduct a data analysis to determine whether the length of a Kickstarter campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.  We looked at campaign results for Plays relative to each campaign's goals, as well as campaigns for all Theater campaigns by launch month.

### Kickstarter Campaigns for Plays, Results by Goals ---

### Kickstarter Campaigns for Theater, Results by Month of Launch ---

### Conclusions
Three conclusions I have drawn from this analysis are:
1. Smaller campaigns are generally more likely to meet their goals.
2. The largest campaigns, whose goals are >$50,000, are very likely to miss their goals.
3. Springtime, especially May, is the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign for a theater.

###  Limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables or graphs
Limitations: There are many factors that very likely influence the success of a Kickstarter campaign that are not included in the data. A few of these factors include properly scoping the campaign, and providing a vivid description of the product and its benefits.  The size of the campaign goal may be a proxy for correct scoping, since smaller (and probably more targeted) campaigns are the most likely to succeed.  
Suggestions: I would like to see a count of videos and images for the campaigns, as well as which social media channels the campaign was promoted on.
